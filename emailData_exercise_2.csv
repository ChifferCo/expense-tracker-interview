We’re excited to help make this celebration unforgettable! Below are the details and important information related to your event:

Package Reminders:

The total guest count includes all attendees (adults and children aged 2 and up).
You can add on up to 5 additional guests to your package. Any additional guests over 5 will upgrade your party package to the next size up.
IMPORTANT - Changes to your party package:

20 - 40 person party packages: Adjustments to the number of attendees can be made on the day of your event. However, we can not upgrade a 40-person to a 50-person package within 7 days
of your party date as a 50-person package requires two hosts.
50-person package : Changes can only be made up to 7 days before your party. You will be unable to downgrade your 50-person package within 7 days of your party date. This is because 50-person
packages require two hosts to accommodate all 50 guests.

Party Itinerary:
9:45 - 10:00AM: Bring party supplies (immediate family only)

10:00 - 11:00AM: Food, cake, & celebrations

11:00 - 11:30AM: Interactive show

11:30 - 11:45AM: Clearing room out

Party guests have general admission to enjoy zoo.

Set up : Immediate family may enter party room 15-minutes before your time slot to set up
Tear down : Immediate family has 15-minutes after your 90-minutes to bring supplies out.

Additional 30-Minutes: $75.00.
Please let us know in advance if you would like to add additional time to your party. We can not guarantee the day of your party that we can accommodate additional time.

Food Reminders:

You’re welcome to bring your own food and drinks, however they must be nut-free & alcohol-free.
If you plan to cut a cake, please bring your own cake-cutting knife.
Please be aware that we do not have a freezer.

Party Supplies:
We provide paper supplies
as part of our standard party setup:

Cups
Plates
Napkins
Cutlery
Table Paper

Bringing Your Own Supplies:

If you prefer to bring your own supplies , you’re welcome to do so. Should you wish for our host to set up using your
party supplies , please ensure they are brought in prior to your event date and notify us in advance.
Please note : Our host will only set up the typical supplies listed above—plates, napkins, cups, cutlery, and tablecloths. Any additional decorations outside of these items (unless
purchased through Reptilia) will not be set up by our host.

Important Decoration Restrictions
We ask that you do NOT bring:

Confetti, glitter, or sequins
Wall decorations (e.g., banners)
Electric hot plates or other burning hazards
Pinatas

Balloons in the zoo or playground (balloons must remain in party rooms)

While we do allow balloons in our party rooms, they must not enter the zoo or playground. Balloons can find their way into our animal exhibits and cause harm to our animals. Balloons
can return to your car after your party is finished. Balloons must not be filled with anything besides helium or air.

Important Deadlines to Remember:

Party Details Confirmation : Please confirm all party details
7 business days prior to the event
Pizza Orders : All pizza orders must be confirmed
before the Wednesday prior to your party
Room Size Changes : Requests for room changes within 7 business days of your party are not guaranteed.

Punctuality & Cancellation Policies

Punctuality : Please ensure all guests arrive on time, as we cannot extend the scheduled room time on the day of your event.

Thank You For Supporting Our Youth &#x200a;
Hello jane,

As we step into the New Year, we are sending our warmest wishes to you for health, happiness, and many moments of joy ahead. On behalf of our residents and staff, thank you for being such an essential part of the YWS family.

Because of you, our shelter truly felt like home this holiday season. Long-time and first-time supporters came together in the most beautiful way. Volunteers showed up with generous donations, helped us sort gift-in-kind items, cooked comforting meals, wrapped presents, and filled our space with care and kindness.

Thanks to your incredible generosity, we were also thrilled to reach our $600,000 goal for the Home for the Holidays Double Match Campaign , making it our most successful holiday campaign to date . This extraordinary milestone will have a lasting impact on the youth we serve and ensure critical programs and supports remain available when they are needed most.

Because of you, our youth were able to enjoy a calm and joyful holiday, something that can be especially hard during this time of year. They opened personalized gifts paired with heartfelt cards of encouragement, shared laughter over games, and enjoyed delicious meals made with love.

The magic did not stop there. The Home Depot team transformed our shelter into a festive wonderland, complete with decorations and a glowing light-up arch at the stairs that made the space feel straight out of a movie scene.
&#xfeff;
Thank you for keeping our youth in your hearts and for standing with us every step of the way. Your generosity, time, and compassion make everything we do possible, and we are deeply grateful to have you as part of our community as we head into the year ahead.

YWS Director of Philanthropy

Thank You For Supporting Our Youth &#x200a;
Hello jane,

As we step into the New Year, we are sending our warmest wishes to you for health, happiness, and many moments of joy ahead. On behalf of our residents and staff, thank you for being such an essential part of the YWS family.

Because of you, our shelter truly felt like home this holiday season. Long-time and first-time supporters came together in the most beautiful way. Volunteers showed up with generous donations, helped us sort gift-in-kind items, cooked comforting meals, wrapped presents, and filled our space with care and kindness.

Thanks to your incredible generosity, we were also thrilled to reach our $600,000 goal for the Home for the Holidays Double Match Campaign , making it our most successful holiday campaign to date . This extraordinary milestone will have a lasting impact on the youth we serve and ensure critical programs and supports remain available when they are needed most.

Because of you, our youth were able to enjoy a calm and joyful holiday, something that can be especially hard during this time of year. They opened personalized gifts paired with heartfelt cards of encouragement, shared laughter over games, and enjoyed delicious meals made with love.

The magic did not stop there. The Home Depot team transformed our shelter into a festive wonderland, complete with decorations and a glowing light-up arch at the stairs that made the space feel straight out of a movie scene.
&#xfeff;
Thank you for keeping our youth in your hearts and for standing with us every step of the way. Your generosity, time, and compassion make everything we do possible, and we are deeply grateful to have you as part of our community as we head into the year ahead.

YWS Director of Philanthropy

I'm not sure if setting isTaxable to true at the line-item level might break saving invoices for this org or others. Even though CodeSignal uses Legacy tax, it looks like NetSuite ignores this option when Per-Line Taxes on Transactions is enabled. So I think it’s safer to keep this set to false and let NetSuite decide how and where taxes should be calculated.
Since everything works well for this org and others, I'd keep it as is for now unless we run into a case that needs it. Wdyt?

AsalamuAlaykum jane, I want to thank you for all your support over the past few days. It has been nothing short of incredible. To think this all started over 10 years ago from 2 boxes stored in a closet! Today we ship orders out to you from one of our 6 warehouse locations worldwide. SubhanAllah. We are more than grateful. Some of you have been with us since 2014 and some of you have just placed your first order very recently. Please know that your satisfaction means everything to us. We love hearing from you to know what you love and also if there is anywhere we fell short so we can make it better. We wouldn't exist without you and everything we do is with you in mind first. In case you want to grab some more jersey hijabs , satin-lined undercaps , instant hijabs or any of your favourites, this is a heads up that our Cyber Monday Sale ends tomorrow. Up to 60% off is hours away from ending, then prices go back up again (until next year). May Allah SWT bless you and your loved ones abundantly, ease your affairs and guide us all to rely on him at any given moment. With love and gratitude, Marwa

yeah @jane as explained on the slack thread, i believe this is fundamentally a bad performance of the feedback agent and that there is no quick fix, although i could be wrong.
if we can detect a pattern of what kind of workflows it struggles, we can improve on this specific problem, but there is a chance performance is degraded somewhere else.
we probably need to do evals on the feedback agent soon.
